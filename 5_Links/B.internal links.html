    <h3 id = "paragraph">What does a paragraph usually consist of?</h3>
    <p>
        A paragraph usually deals with a single idea. In general, you’ll have an introductory sentence expressing that idea, and several supporting sentences to round it off. Paragraphs are usually about 100 – 200 words long, but there are more exceptions to this rule-of-thumb than you’d expect.
        
        Commercial Writing



        <br>
        Commercial writing breaks all the rules. Whether or not you find it irritating, your task is to hold your readers’ attention and get them to read what you’ve written. The average person doesn’t like to see solid blocks of text. It looks like it’s going to be difficult to get through, and nobody likes to work harder than they have to.
        
        “White Space” is a great way to make your information look easier to master, and one of the best ways to create “white space” is through using paragraphs. For commercial writing, it’s best to keep sentences short and punchy, and the same goes for paragraphs.
        
        People don’t usually like to see paragraphs that are more than three or four lines long. How many words is that? Again, although it’s not helpful, the answer is “It depends…” Font styles and font size will affect paragraph length – at least from a psychological perspective.
        
        For example, this is a blog post, and I want to keep the reader engaged. The longest paragraph under this heading is only 61 words long. This is the shortest one so far, and it only uses 37 words.
        
        I want to get your attention!
        
        The above paragraph is only six words long, and you can count the words in this one if you like.
        
        Dialogues
        To make things easy for your reader, you’ll switch paragraphs every time you switch speakers, for example:
        
        “I don’t know how long a paragraph should be,” said Mary, “but I hope to find out by reading this article.”
        
        “That sounds like a good idea,” John replied, “but don’t let that limit your creativity!”
        
        “Really? Can I bend the rules?”
        
        “The rules are really more like guidelines.”
        
        “Cool!”
        
        As you can see, I was able to stop identifying the speakers as soon as the conversation began to flow because John and Mary each had paragraphs to themselves. Neither of them said anything that was even close to 100 words, but it’s still easy to see who said what. Mary’s final paragraph was one word long.
